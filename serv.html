				<u><h2>Surgery</h2></u>
				<p>There’s something about surgery that can be stressful and nerve wracking, whether it’s a human or an animal family member. Here at Stevens Animal Hospital, we understand the uncertainty you are experiencing and want to put your mind at ease. We’ve worked hard to ensure that each surgery performed at our hospital, whether routine or complex, is as stress free as possible. When it comes to surgical care, your pet’s safety and comfort are our top priority! We offer a variety of surgical services, all performed using the most modern techniques and equipment and always adhering to the highest standards of care. Our new state of the art Laser surgical suite provides a clean, well-lit environment where Dr. Mark and his surgical team can deliver the highest quality surgical care- before, during, and following any procedure.</p>
