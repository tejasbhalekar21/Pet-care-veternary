				<u><h2>LAB</h2></u>
				<b><i><p>Veterinary diagnostics are invaluable tools that allow our experienced veterinarians to get a look at what’s happening inside your pet’s body so we can diagnose and treat the problem in a timely manner. Early detection and treatment can vastly improve the outcome for your companion. Stevens Animal Hospital utilizes a wide range of diagnostic services, both routine and advanced to manage the ongoing health of our patients. We have a brand new digital X-Ray machine as well as an ECG machine for heart evaluations. Our in-house Lab provides for the fast and accurate retrieval of a wide variety of diagnostic results including; blood serum chemistries, hematology, and serology, as well as urinalysis, and parasite testing. For those situations where an expert opinion or further testing is recommended, we also utilize commercial veterinary laboratories for specialized diagnostics and can arrange for consultations with board certified veterinary specialists.</p></b></i></center>
